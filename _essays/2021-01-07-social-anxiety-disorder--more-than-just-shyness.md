#### Introduction

#### 引言:

Are you extremely afraid of being judged by others?

你是否极度害怕被别人批判？

Are you very self-conscious in everyday social situations?

你是否在日常的社交环境有很强的自我意识或者自我关注？

Do you avoid meeting new people?

你逃避认识陌生人吗？

If you have been feeling this way for at least six months and these feelings make it hard for you to do everyday tasks—such as talking to people at work or school—you may have a social anxiety disorder.

如果你至少有六个月的这种感受，并且这种感受让你很难做好日常的任务，比如在工作或学校中与人交谈，那么你可能存在社交焦虑症。

Social anxiety disorder (also called social phobia) is a mental health condition. It is an intense, persistent fear of being watched and judged by others. This fear can affect work, school, and your other day-to-day activities. It can even make it hard to make and keep friends. But social anxiety disorder doesn’t have to stop you from reaching your potential. Treatment can help you overcome your symptoms.

社交焦虑症（也称社交恐惧）是一种精神健康状况，是一种强烈的，长久的害怕被他人关注和批判的恐惧，这种恐惧感会影响到工作、上学以及其他的日常活动。甚至很难结交朋友。但是社会焦虑症并不一定会阻止你发挥自己的潜能。通过治疗可以帮助你应对并克服这些症状。

#### What is it like having social anxiety disorder?

#### 社交焦虑症患者有那些感受？ 

“In school, I was always afraid of being called on, even when I knew the answers. I didn’t want people to think I was stupid or boring. My heart would pound and I would feel dizzy and sick. When I got a job, I hated to meet with my boss or talk in a meeting. I couldn’t attend my best friend’s wedding reception because I was afraid of having to meet new people. I tried to calm myself by drinking several glasses of wine before an event and then I started drinking every day to try to face what I had to do.”

“在学校里，即使我知道答案，我也总是怕被点名回答问题。我不想让别人认为我很愚蠢和无聊。我的心脏会急速跳动，我会感到头晕和不适。工作中，我讨厌和老板见面或开会。因为害怕结识陌生人，我无法参加我最好朋友的婚礼。在活动开始前，我会尝试喝几倍酒以使自己保持镇定，逐渐地，我也开始尝试通过饮酒去面对日常中自己必须做的事情。”

“I finally talked to my doctor because I was tired of feeling this way and I was worried that I would lose my job. I now take medicine and meet with a counselor to talk about ways to cope with my fears. I refuse to use alcohol to escape my fears and I’m on my way to feeling better.”

“因为我厌倦了这种感觉，并且害怕丢掉搬砖的工作，我终于开始和自己的医生交谈。我开始试着接受医学治疗，与指导医生谈论应对恐惧的方法。我不再通过酒精让自己逃避恐惧。后来，我感觉我的情况开始在慢慢地改善。”

#### What is social anxiety disorder?

#### 什么是社交焦虑症？

Social anxiety disorder is a common type of anxiety disorder. A person with social anxiety disorder feels symptoms of anxiety or fear in certain or all social situations, such as meeting new people, dating, being on a job interview, answering a question in class, or having to talk to a cashier in a store. Doing everyday things in front of people—such as eating or drinking in front of others or using a public restroom—also causes anxiety or fear. The person is afraid that he or she will be humiliated, judged, and rejected.

社交焦虑症是焦虑症的一种常见类型。有社交焦虑症的人在某些或者所有的社交环境中都会感到焦虑或恐惧，例如结识新朋友，约会，工作面试，在课堂上回答问题，或者与商店的收银员谈话。在人们面前做日常的事情，例如在他人面前吃喝或者使用公共卫生间，也会引起焦虑或恐惧。社交焦虑症患者害怕被自己被羞辱，被批判和被拒绝。

The fear that people with social anxiety disorder have in social situations is so strong that they feel it is beyond their ability to control. As a result, it gets in the way of going to work, attending school, or doing everyday things. People with social anxiety disorder may worry about these and other things for weeks before they happen. Sometimes, they end up staying away from places or events where they think they might have to do something that will embarrass them.

社交焦虑症患者在社交环境中的有很强的恐惧感，以至于超出他们的自我控制。结果，这种难以抑制的恐惧感妨碍了他们的工作，上学或者其他的日常活动。有社交焦虑症的人在面对即将可能发生的事情的数周前，就会开始担心这些事情。有时，他们会选择远离这些使他们感到尴尬不安的地方或者事情。

Some people with the disorder do not have anxiety in social situations but have performance anxiety instead. They feel physical symptoms of anxiety in situations such as giving a speech, playing a sports game, or dancing or playing a musical instrument on stage.

有些人的焦虑并非表现在社交环境而是某种表现焦虑（performance anxiety）。在演讲，玩体育类游戏，在舞台上跳舞或者演奏乐器的情况下，他们会出现到身体的焦虑不适症状。

Social anxiety disorder usually starts during youth in people who are extremely shy. Social anxiety disorder is not uncommon; research suggests that about 7 percent of Americans are affected. Without treatment, social anxiety disorder can last for many years or a lifetime and prevent a person from reaching his or her full potential.

社交焦虑症通常在那些有着极度害羞现的人的年轻的时候开始出现。社交焦虑症并不常见，研究表明，大约有7%的美国人有社交焦虑症。如果社交焦虑症不进行治疗，症状可能会持续很多年或一生，并影响一个人发挥其全部的潜能。

#### What are the signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder?

#### 社交焦虑症有那些迹象和症状？

When having to perform in front of or be around others, people with social anxiety disorder tend to:

当社交焦虑症患者不得不在他人面前或者周围时，他们会有如下表现：

- Blush, sweat, tremble, feel a rapid heart rate, or feel their “mind going blank”
- 脸红，出汗，发抖，心跳加快，卡壳或者大脑一片空白

- Feel nauseous or sick to their stomach
- 感到恶心或肠胃不适

- Show a rigid body posture, make little eye contact, or speak with an overly soft voice
- 表现出僵硬的身体姿势，几乎没有眼神交流，说话声过度轻柔

- Find it scary and difficult to be with other people, especially those they don’t already know, and have a hard time talking to them even though they wish they could
- 与其他人，尤其时他们不认识的人交谈，会感到恐惧和困难，即使是那些他们特别希望与之交谈的人

- Be very self-conscious in front of other people and feel embarrassed and awkward
- 在他人面前有很强的自我意识或者过度自我关注，会感到非常局促和不安

- Be very afraid that other people will judge them
- 非常害怕别人的批判

- Stay away from places where there are other people
- 离群索居

#### What causes social anxiety disorder?

#### 什么导致了社交焦虑症？

Social anxiety disorder sometimes runs in families, but no one knows for sure why some family members have it while others don’t. Researchers have found that several parts of the brain are involved in fear and anxiety. Some researchers think that misreading of others’ behavior may play a role in causing or worsening social anxiety. For example, you may think that people are staring or frowning at you when they truly are not. Underdeveloped social skills are another possible contributor to social anxiety. For example, if you have underdeveloped social skills, you may feel discouraged after talking with people and may worry about doing it in the future. By learning more about fear and anxiety in the brain, scientists may be able to create better treatments. Researchers are also looking for ways in which stress and environmental factors may play a role.

社交焦虑症有时会出现家族聚集现象，但没人知道为什么有些家庭成员却没有社交焦虑症。研究人员发现，大脑中有几个部分都与恐惧和焦虑有关。一些研究人员认为，对他人行为的误解可能会导致社交焦虑甚或者加剧社交焦虑。例如，你可能认为有人在盯着你或者对你皱眉，尽管真实的情况并非如此。**缺乏社交技能也是另外一种导致社交焦虑的原因之一。**例如，如果你没有什么社交技能，在与人交谈后，你可能会感到沮丧，并担心你的这种行为的未来表现。通过对大脑中焦虑和恐惧的更多的了解，科学家也许可以发现更好的治疗方法。研究人员发现，压力和环境因素也可能是导致焦虑的原因。

#### How is social anxiety disorder treated?

#### 如何治疗社交焦虑症？

First, talk to your doctor or health care professional about your symptoms. Your doctor should do an exam and ask you about your health history to make sure that an unrelated physical problem is not causing your symptoms. Your doctor may refer you to a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, clinical social worker, or counselor. The first step to effective treatment is to have a diagnosis made, usually by a mental health specialist.

首先，与你的医生或者健康顾问谈谈自己的症状。医生应该对你做进一步的检查，并询问你的健康史，以确保无关的身体问题不是导致这些症状的原因。你的医生可能会将你介绍给心理健康专家，例如精神科医生，心理学家，临床社会工作者或者顾问。通常心理健康专家的诊断是有效治疗的第一步。

Social anxiety disorder is generally treated with psychotherapy (sometimes called “talk” therapy), medication, or both. Speak with your doctor or health care provider about the best treatment for you. If your health care provider cannot provide a referral, visit the NIMH Help for Mental Illnesses web page at [www.nimh.nih.gov/findhelp](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/findhelp) for resources you may find helpful.

社交焦虑症通常采用的是心理疗法（有时称为“谈话”疗法），药物或者两种兼有。与你的医生或者健康顾问谈谈最适合你的治疗方法。如果你的健康顾问无法提供给你处理方案，可以访问 [NIMH](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/findhelp) 以获取可能对你有用的资源。

##### Psychotherapy

##### 心理治疗

A type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is especially useful for treating social anxiety disorder. CBT teaches you different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations that help you feel less anxious and fearful. It can also help you learn and practice social skills. CBT delivered in a group format can be especially helpful. For more information on psychotherapy, please visit [www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies).

一种称为认知行为疗法（CBT）的心理疗法对治疗社交焦虑症特别有用。CBT 可以教给你不同的思考方式，行为方式和反映方式应对社交环境，以帮你减少焦虑和恐惧，同时也可以帮你练习和实践社交技能。以小组的形式进行 CBT 治疗尤其有用。有关心理治疗的更多信息，请访问 [www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies)

##### Support Groups

##### 支持小组

Many people with social anxiety also find support groups helpful. In a group of people who all have social anxiety disorder, you can receive unbiased, honest feedback about how others in the group see you. This way, you can learn that your thoughts about judgment and rejection are not true or are distorted. You can also learn how others with social anxiety disorder approach and overcome the fear of social situations.

许多患有社交焦虑症的人发现支持小组也很有帮助。在一群都有社交焦虑症的人中，你会收到他人如何看待你的公正的，真诚的反馈。这样，你可以了解到那些你想象中的被批判和被拒绝并不是真实的。你还可以了解到其他患有社交焦虑症的人如何应对并克服对社交环境的恐惧。

##### Medication

##### 药物

There are three types of medications used to help treat social anxiety disorder:

有三种类型的药物可以用来治疗社交焦虑症：

- Anti-anxiety medications
- 抗焦虑药

- Antidepressants
- 抗抑郁药

- Beta-blockers
- Beta阻滞剂

Anti-anxiety medications are powerful and begin working right away to reduce anxious feelings; however, these medications are usually not taken for long periods of time. People can build up a tolerance if they are taken over a long period of time and may need higher and higher doses to get the same effect. Some people may even become dependent on them. To avoid these problems, doctors usually prescribe anti-anxiety medications for short periods, a practice that is especially helpful for older adults.

抗焦虑药物功能强大，可以起到立竿见影的效果。但是，这些药物并不能长时间服用。如果长时间服用，可能会引起抗药性，并且可能会需要越来越多的剂量才能获得同样的效果，有些人甚至对抗焦虑药产生依赖。为了避免这些问题，医生通常会在短期内开出抗焦虑药物，这对于大龄人尤其有用。

Antidepressants are mainly used to treat depression, but are also helpful for the symptoms of social anxiety disorder. In contrast to anti-anxiety medications, they may take several weeks to start working. Antidepressants may also cause side effects, such as headaches, nausea, or difficulty sleeping. These side effects are usually not severe for most people, especially if the dose starts off low and is increased slowly over time. Talk to your doctor about any side effects that you have.

抗抑郁药主要用于治疗抑郁，但对于社交焦虑症的症状同样有所帮助。与抗焦虑药相反，抗抑郁药可能要数周才能起效。抗抑郁药同样可能引起副作用，例如头痛，恶心，或者失眠。对于大多数人来说，这些副作用通常并不严重，特别是那些随着时间从小剂量慢慢增加的情况。记得和你的医生谈谈有关任何你身上的副作用。

Beta-blockers are medicines that can help block some of the physical symptoms of anxiety on the body, such as an increased heart rate, sweating, or tremors. Beta-blockers are commonly the medications of choice for the “performance anxiety” type of social anxiety.

Beta 受体阻滞剂是可以帮助缓解身体上某些焦虑症状的药物，例如心律加快，出汗或震颤。 Beta 受体阻滞剂通常是“表现焦虑”型社交焦虑的首选药物。

Your doctor will work with you to find the best medication, dose, and duration of treatment. Many people with social anxiety disorder obtain the best results with a combination of medication and CBT or other psychotherapies.

您的医生将与您一起寻找最佳药物，剂量和治疗持续时间。许多社交焦虑症患者通过药物，CBT 或其他心理疗法的组合可获得最佳效果。

Don't give up on treatment too quickly. Both psychotherapy and medication can take some time to work. A healthy lifestyle can also help combat anxiety. Make sure to get enough sleep and exercise, eat a healthy diet, and turn to family and friends who you trust for support.

**不要太早放弃治疗。心理治疗和药物治疗都需要花费一些时间。健康的生活方式同样可以帮助消除焦虑。保障充足的睡眠和锻炼，健康饮食，并寻求你信任的家人和朋友的支持。**
